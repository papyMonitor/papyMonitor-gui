## Description

papyMonitor is a multiplatform (Windows, Linux, Mac, ...) tool to interactively receive/edit/monitor data and send commands to an embedded device with the serial port. The embedded device can be Arduino, pic, AVR, ARM,...).

It is fast, real time (the embedded system is the master) and proudly made with Godot Engine. The language used is C#, the user configuration file rely on Lua but is very easy to understand and to modify. This tool is already used in production but has for sure some bugs to discover. The MAC version has not been tested since we don't have a MAC, so developers are welcome.
