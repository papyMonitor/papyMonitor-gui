## Description

papyMonitor-gui is a multiplatform (Windows, Linux, Mac, ...) tool to interactively receive/edit/monitor data and send commands to an embedded system with the serial port. The embedded system can be Arduino (all flavors supported), PIC, AVR, ARM,... or a computer.

The tool provide a multifunction plotter as well a 3D display to simulate real mechanical systems.

It is fast, real time (the embedded system is the master) and proudly made with Godot Engine. The language used is C#, the user configuration file rely on Lua language but is very easy to manipulate.

This tool is already used in production but -for sure- still has some bugs to discover. The MAC version has not been tested since we don't have a MAC, so developers are welcome.
